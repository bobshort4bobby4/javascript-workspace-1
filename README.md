# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

It is a version of the kids memory card game, familiar to most people.  The aim is to turn the cards over in pairs and 
note the position of the various icons on the face side, if they match they are  left face-side up, if not matched they
are flipped back to blank-side up.  The game is won when all the pairs are found.
<br>

Memory games have been shown to greatly help children develop key skills. Brain functions such as focus, attention and concentration
are improved by games such as this one. Visual recognition is also improved as is both short-term and long-term memory.<br>
Adults also can greatly benefit from 'exercising' the brain, as any activity which encourages mental activity maintains and
can improve mental function.

  <summary>User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)</summary>
  
  ### User Stories
  
  ##### First Time Visitor Goals
  As a first time visitor I want:<br>
  - the rules and final aim of the game to be obvious.<br>
  - to be entertained and engaged with the game from the initial load.<br>
  - the game to function correctly and gameplay to be intuitive.
  - to be able to play the game on various different devices.
  
  ##### Return/frequent Visitor Goals.
  As a return/frequent visitor I want:<br>
  - to be able to gauge/score my performance.
  - to be able to challenge myself by increasing difficulty of the game.
  - to be able to play the game on various different devices.
  - to be able to mute music/sound effects if so desired.
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.
  As the developer I want:
  - to provide a fun game.
  - to provide a game to stimulate mental function.
  - to encourage continued use of the game.
            
  
  ### Design
  
  
  ##### Colour Scheme 
  I trialled  many different colour palettes whilst building the game and settled on a simple combination of shades of red, blue and black.
  Black is used for text colour and contrasts well with the other two primary colours.  Default Orange was used for the ink colour for the times as black
  did not shown up well against the background in the chosen font.  Lightsalmon was used for the display box in the modal screen.

  ##### Typography
  I choose 'Titan One' as the font for the site. It is a big bold type that stands out from the background well and is easy to read.

 # Deployment
  <details>
    
  <summary>Deployment</summary>
  
  This project was built on the Gitpod IDE using the Code Institute template found here:<br>https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template
    <br>
    
#### GitHub Pages
   
  GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service which uses files from a GitHub repository to publish a website.  I used Github Pages to deploy this project
    following the process set out below.<br>
    
  1. Open the Github repository page you wish to publish, in this case [Here](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Flipping-Tiles-Game-PP2/).
  1. Click on the 'Settings' option from the list of options above the repo contents.
  1. Scroll down the page untill the Github Pages heading appears and click on the link 'Check it out here!".
  1. Select Branch Main and leave /root unchanged.
  1. Click 'Save'.
  1. The URL for the website will be shown in a panel towards the top of the page.  After a brief wait it will turn green indicating the website is published.

#### Forking
  Forking a Github repository is the the process of making a copy of any repository that you can use without affecting the original, this original is known as the 
  "upstream repository".
  The process for forking a repository is set out below.
  1. Go to the Github page that hosts the repository you wish to fork.
  1. On the top-right of the page there is a button "Fork".
  1. Click this button.
  1. This creates a repository in your Github home page which is a copy of the original. You can submit and receive changes to the code by using pull requests 
  and/or syncing with the upstream repository.
    
  (Taken from the Github Docs guide "Forking Projects")
    
#### Cloning 
  Cloning a repository involves making a full copy of that repository on your local machine. This makes working on the code easier.  Changes can be pushed back up to the 
  GitHub site or changes from other sources pulled to your local copy. To make a clone follow the process below.
  1. Goto the repository page on GitHub.
  1. Above the file list click on the green button titled "Code".
  1. You can choose to download a zip file of the repository, unpack it on your local machine and open it in your IDE or,
  1. Clone using HTTPS by copying the URL under the HTTPS tab.
  1. Open a terminal window, set current directory to the one you want to contain the clone.
  1. Type `git clone `and paste the URL copied from the GitHub page.
  1. The repository clone will be created on your machine.

  #### Code/Reference 
  The method of placing two identical divs on top of each other using different display properties, I learned from a You-Tube video by [Shaun Pelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhKdOrOh90w&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5&index=13&t=401s).  
  I referenced this video by [freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek&t=1697s) to help me get the flipping animation working properly and some aspects of     program flow.  
  I used [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio) to learn about the use of the Audio constructor.  
  The [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp) website was also used particularly in relation to element attributes and how best to set them.  
  I referenced the Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).  
  I learned the method for adding a leading 0 to one digit time values at [TechnicalCafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1INmsFnD-u4&t=59s).  
  I used the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja) "Modern Javascript" course for information regarding Modal screens, 
  event delegation and arrow functions.  
  The [Code Institute](https://www.CodeInstitute.net) course material.
  
  
  #### Thanks
  Thank you to my Mentor Mr. Ben Kavanagh and to the Code Institute tutor who pointed me in the right direction regarding which parameters to use when comparing two elements.
