# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

It is a version of the kids memory card game, familiar to most people.  The aim is to turn the cards over in pairs and 
note the position of the various icons on the face side, if they match they are  left face-side up, if not matched they
are flipped back to blank-side up.  The game is won when all the pairs are found.
<br>

Memory games have been shown to greatly help children develop key skills. Brain functions such as focus, attention and concentration
are improved by games such as this one. Visual recognition is also improved as is both short-term and long-term memory.<br>
Adults also can greatly benefit from 'exercising' the brain, as any activity which encourages mental activity maintains and
can improve mental function.

  - to be able to challenge myself by increasing difficulty of the game.
  - to be able to play the game on various different devices.
  - to be able to mute music/sound effects if so desired.
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.

  ### Design
  
  
  ##### Colour Scheme 
  I trialled  many different colour palettes whilst building the game and settled on a simple combination of shades of red, blue and black.
  Black is used for text colour and contrasts well with the other two primary colours.  Default Orange was used for the ink colour for the times as black
  did not shown up well against the background in the chosen font.  Lightsalmon was used for the display box in the modal screen.

  ##### Typography
  I choose 'Titan One' as the font for the site. It is a big bold type that stands out from the background well and is easy to read.
